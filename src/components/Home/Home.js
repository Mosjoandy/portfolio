            <p>My name is Nicholas Chan. I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I enjoy motorcycles, rockhounding,
                    wild edible foraging, camping, traveling, computer games, movies, and mostly anything sci-fi or fantasy-related.

            <p>My previous career was in Recreation Therapy, where I used recreation as my medium of therapy. I spent 6
                years working and perfecting my skills in the field in an acute psychiatric facility. Using recreation
                therapy, I helped rehabilitate patients with mental illnesses or disorders, improving their quality of
                life. However, I slowly began to discover that I wanted to pursue a different career.
            </p>

            <p>I searched online and found all sorts of coding bootcamps. UC Berkeley offered an immersive 3-month bootcamp.
                I spent my entire life on the computer. Whether it was for leisure or for work, I was constantly hammering
                away on a keyboard. I realized that this was something worth pursuing, combining my work and leisure
                into one. I dropped everything and moved away from my home in Los Angeles to the Bay Area. Being able
                to live nomadically helped out tremendously, making the transition relatively easy.
            </p>

            <p>After graduating from UC Berkeley's Coding Bootcamp, I have been working at refining my skills in tech, while
                searching for entry level positions. The bootcamp laid a foundation of self-learning in high-pressure environments,
                so cramming new languages and concepts felt the norm. Every day and week, I spend polishing past projects, or learning.
